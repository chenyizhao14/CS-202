# CSC 202 Data Structures @ Cal Poly SLO
## Professor Dr. Paul Hatalsky - Fall 2022

## The Class
Professor Hatalsky was a really good professor. He was really thorough and explained everything very well. Since it was my first quarter in college, I didn't know what to expect and didn't do as well as I had hoped, but this class really laid down the foundations for computer science. 

## Content
This is my coursework for the class. Each Lab and Project have the instructions in pdfs and all the code.
